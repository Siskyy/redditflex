# This project is in development!

I am currently building this React web app as my next ambitious project! I plan on making a simplified application for reddit where the user can view content and switch between subreddits, with a simple UI and UX.

## Technologies used

- Languages
  - HTML & CSS
  - JavaScript
- Frameworks
  - ReactJS
  - Redux
- APIs
  - Reddit API - From [Reddit] (https://www.reddit.com/)

## wireframing

## Next up

- implement toggle comments button on each post
- if toggle comments is on:
  - fetch comments for that post.id
  - else fetch nothing

-render full contents of each post

- done?!
